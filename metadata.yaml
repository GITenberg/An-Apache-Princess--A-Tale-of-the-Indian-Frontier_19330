description: U.S. soldier Charles King first saw the battlefield during the American
  Indian Wars and, by 1898, had worked his way up to the rank of Brigadier General.
  After retirement, the battle-scarred veteran turned his attention to literature,
  penning dozens of action-packed novels, stories, and screenplays. An Apache Princess
  recounts the tale of a grizzled lieutenant whose daring exploits on the battlefield
  are bested only by his romantic entanglements with a handful of markedly different
  women.
